The Wort is produced by mixing a starch source ( most often malted and crushed grains / barley a.k.a malts ) with hot water , this step is known as Mashing . This process takes a few hours , and causes the starches to break down into sugars . 2 . The Wort is drained from the malts , and the malts rinsed to remove as much of the sweet wort as possible . The sweet Wort and associated washings are trasnfered into a kettle ( known as a copper ) , and boiled for a few hours . This boils off some of the water , and produces a more concentrated Wort , allowing for a more efficient fermentation later on . The boiling also kills off any remaining enzymes / bacteria in the Wort , effectively sterylizing it . During the boil , hops are pitched into the Wort to add a bitter flavour . The longer the hops are boiled , the more bitter the final brew will be , but the less light - hoppy aroma you get on the palate . Careful selection of hop variety , as well as knowing when to pitch the hops is essential in producing the champion brews ! 3 . After the Wort is boiled , it 's cooled ready for the yeast . If the wort stays too hot it 'll kill the yeast , and you wo n't get any beer . Some breweries may hop the wort at this late stage , to give a powerfully hoppy aroma to the final brew . The hopped and cooled Wort is transfered to the fermenter , where the yeast is then pitched . During fermentation , the yeast digests the sugars in the Wort , producing ethanol ( alcohol - gets you drunk ) and carbon dioxide ( makes it gassy / fizzy ) . The fermentation step can take anywhere from days to months , depending on the brew .. but this long period allows any particulate matter to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter , resulting in a clear beer . 4 . Once the fermentation has finished , the final beer product is bottled / canned / casked . Then either stored on racks to mature , or sold and enjoyed straight away ! The different types of beers are usually achieved by the types of grains / hops used , as well as the stage in which the hops are pitched , how many hoppings are carried out etc .. sometimes the beer undergoes a few fermentations too .. With beer being up to 11,000 + years old , we 've had a long long time to perfect our methods and develop lots of different types !\"\\n \"in essences , beer is just : 1 ) Water - well , most of your beer is water . 2 ) Yeast - the thing that turns sugar in malts into alcohol during fermentation . there 's also various types of yeast for ales / lagers that give them different flavors and smell . 3 ) Malt - nowadays , there 's malt extracts , basically , a sugar syrup . however , you can always soak different grains for their sugar . again , different malt different flavors and smell . 4 ) Hops - they add flavors and preserves the beer . again , different hops different flavors and smell . ps . /r / homebrewing . you can start brewing your own beer ( 5gallons or ~50bottles ) &lt; $ 100 .\"\\n '[ BOOM INFOGRAM IN YO FACE ] ( URL_0 )']</td>\n",

Lagers are made with bottom-fermenting yeasts, which means the yeast settles to the bottom of the mixture as it ferments. Lagers tend to have a cleaner, crisper flavor.\\n\\nThere are many different types of ales and lagers, such as pale ales, stouts, pilsners, and many more. Each type has its own unique flavor and characteristics, and people often enjoy trying different types to find their favorite.']</td>\n",

       "      <td>['Software does not \" physically \" interact with the hardware . Software is a way in which the hardware operates to produce a change in the charge of transistors . The booting hardware prepares itself for interaction between itself and other hardware when you first boot it up . This preparation makes it possible for software to make changes to hardware , which is really just hardware operating in a specific way to make other hardware react in a specific way . Eventually , your hardware reaches a point that ordered changes in your peripheral hardware ( typing ) causes ordered changes to your internal hardware . The software is n\\'t really interacting in a physical manner .'\\n 'Software is not something distinct from the hardware . Software is the state of the hardware . This state can represent either data or rules about how the hardware will manipulate its state so you can have programs . The hardware is made up of storage elements ( CPU registers , RAM ) and control circuits . The storage elements hold the states . The hardware can manipulate some of the state by moving it from storage to the inputs of the control circuits . These control circuits will then do different manipulations on other state such as addition , comparing or copying , or fetching another piece of state and applying it to the control circuits to make them do something else .'\\n 'There \\'s a huge number of way for the 1s and 0s stored in memory to \" access \" the hardware . I \\'ve not done any useful work at such a low level for years now , but as far as I can remember , the main idea behind hardware interaction is through three mechanisms : * the CPU has a special instruction that triggers said interaction , and thus just calling it is sufficient to have the hardware do your bid ; * some addresses in memory are in fact \" mapped \" to some hardware , and writing to them triggers a function of the mapped hardware - or reading them allow to get a reply from said hardware * the hardware \" interrupts \" the current operation of the CPU , making it execute some code you registered previously to this interrupt As I said , did n\\'t wrote assembler for a few years now , so I understand that Direct Memory Access and such may have change a bit of the way a computer works , but I guess it \\'s still close to the three aforementioned methods .']</td>\n",

       "      <td>[\"I 'm going to assume you know what an equation is , basic math , and how equations work . A * solution * to an equation is a set of number that satisfy that equation . For example , we can look at the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 . If we pick x to be 3 , y to be 4 , and z to be 5 , then we have a solution since x^2 + y^2 = 3 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5 ^ 2 = z^2 . Notice that our solution — x = 3 , y = 4 , z = 5 — is made of counting numbers ? We can consider a generalization of the above equation , x^n + y^n = z^n , where n is any counting number itself , and ask whether * that * equation has a solution made up entirely of counting numbers . For example , we could look at the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3 , or x^10 + y^10 = z^10 . So we 've established that if n is 2 , then there are solutions made up only of counting numbers ( we used 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . Fermat 's Last Theorem says that if n is * bigger * than 2 then you ca n't find a solution made up only of counting numbers . If two of the numbers in your solution are counting numbers , then the third one wo n't be a counting number . The known proof of this theorem can not be explained like you 're five . It is highly technical and relies on extremely advanced mathematical techniques developed in the late 1900s .\"\\n \"I ca n't explain it , this comment is n't big enough .\"\\n 'Fermat \\'s Last Theorem states that there do not exist three nonzero integers x , y , and z such that x^n + y^n = z^n for any n larger than 2 . This is in contrast to the case where n=1 , which is pretty trivial , and the case n=2 , where there are examples like 3 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 5 ^ 2 One way to see that this is sort of crazy if true , is to consider it this way : if x^n + y^n = z^n then ( x / z)^n + ( y / z)^n = 1 . Then the theorem comes down to saying there are no pairs ( x , y ) of nonzero rational numbers on the plane curve defined by the equation x^n + y^n = 1 . For n=4 , this curve looks like [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . By the FLT that curve slips \" in between \" all the rational number pairs , never hitting them except along the axes . The proof that this is true is one of the most complicated proofs in modern mathematics . It took 7 years for one of the world \\'s best mathematicians to finish . Any ELI5 description would be hopelessly inadequate . The proof involved taking two fields which were previously thought to be unrelated and showing they are actually the same . Once this was done ( or rather , a part of this , the full thing was done later ) , we can take the FLT and translate it to a problem in this other field , where there exist techniques to tackle it there .']</td>\n",
       "      <td>[\"Fermat's Last Theorem is a famous math problem that states that there are no whole numbers (also called integers) that can be used to solve the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for any value of n greater than 2. For example, the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3 has no solutions in whole numbers. Fermat's Last Theorem is called a theorem because it has been proven to be true. It was first proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in the 17th century, but it wasn't until 1994 that a mathematician named Andrew Wiles was able to provide a complete proof of the theorem. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is quite complex and requires a lot of advanced math. However, there is a simple way to understand why the theorem is true: if we try to find whole number solutions to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for any value of n greater than 2, we quickly run into problems. For example, if we try to find whole number solutions to the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3, we can quickly see that there are no solutions. This is because no matter what values we choose for x, y, and z, the left side of the equation (x^3 + y^3) will always be a multiple of 3 (since 3 is a factor of every whole number), while the right side of the equation (z^3) will never be a multiple of 3. This means that the equation can never be true, no matter what values we choose for x, y, and z. In conclusion, Fermat's Last Theorem states that there are no whole number solutions to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for any value of n greater than 2. This theorem was famously difficult to prove, but it has now been proven to be true by mathematician Andrew Wiles.\"]</td>\n",

Then the airlines went back and retrofitted the plane to reduce the spacing between seats add additional seats . So not only do you not have any leg room but you ca n't see out the window either .\"\\n 'Planes fly for decades , and get remodelled on a regular basis . Sometimes they reduce space to put in more seats , sometime they increase space with fewer seats , sometimes both , like when they convert to an economy plus seating configuration . All of those will wind up with the windows no longer being aligned to the seats .']   \n",

The power for the battery that powers electronic things comes from the engine . If you use more of that power you use more fuel . Your car radio uses almost none of that power , so it does n\\'t drain your battery . Your AC partially uses the engine \" directly \" but the fan is powered by the battery . The AC uses too much energy to just run off the battery and since the battery comes from the engine anyway it \\'s more efficient to just power it directly then going through the battery .'\\n \"Everything that requires power in your car causes you to use more fuel . This is because your car battery is charged by the alternator in the engine , which causes some drag and drops fuel efficiency by a bit , since some of the energy from the engine is going to the battery instead of the wheels . That being said , most things on the battery require relatively little energy , so you do n't really notice . Your AC on the other hand has a big compressor which takes quite a bit more energy from the engine ( attached to a belt ) to run . When it 's off it 's mechanically disconnected from the engine , causing almost no loss of power at all .\"]   \n",

West is a direction . 60 miles per hour is a speed . West at 60 miles per hour is a vector .\"\\n 'In what context ? Vector is a Latin word that means \" carrier \" and has come to mean a number of different but sometimes conceptually similar things in different areas . Several people have posted answers explaining what a vector means in physics ( a direction and a speed ) , but maybe you \\'re after vectors in computer graphics - vector graphics are essentially descriptions of lines connecting points and are infinitely scaleable unlike bitmaps or raster images which are collections of pixels and become pixelated if you zoom in too far . Or perhaps you are interested in vectors in biology . Like Altiondsols says , vectors in molecular biology are tools used to insert DNA into a cell ( or you might think of them as tools to \\' carry \\' DNA from cell to cell ) . Also , in epidemiology ( the study of the spread of diseases ) a vector is an organism that transmits ( or carries ) a pathogen to another organism . Examples of vector - borne diseases are malaria which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and Lyme disease , which is transmitted to humans by ticks .'\\n \"A vector is a quantity that defines both magnitude and direction . It can be visually shown as an arrow in 2D or 3D , or quantitatively as 2 or 3 numbers . For example , if you are looking down to the ground from high up you see 2 cars . One is moving east at 20 m / s and the other is moving north - west at 30 m / s. a vector in this situation can be described as an arrow in 2D. For the first car , it 's speed is a vector with magnitude 20 and direction to the right . For the second car , it 's speed is a vector with magnitude 30 and direction up - left . The arrow for the second car will be longer than the first because its magnitude is higher . In short , a vector is an arrow describing some quantity of an object with its magnitude as the length of the arrow , and the direction as the direction of the arrow . Vectors are very important in physics and multivariable calculus .\"]   \n",

If you push on a molecule , it has a lot of empty space to move into . So it is easy to compress the gas . In a liquid , the molecules are almost touching . ( Molecules do n\\'t really have well - enough - defined boundaries to \" touch \" , but it \\'s OK to think of them that way to a first approximation . ) There is a little bit of space , but not much . So when you push on one water molecule , the neighboring molecules push back on it , and their neighbors push back on them , and so on , making liquid water much harder to compress than a gas .'\\n \"Ca n't wait to hear this discussed . I was an electrician on aircraft in the Air Force , and we often ventured into some components where we overlapped with the hydraulic mechanics . I 've heard numerous times that water is n't compressible , so would n't make a good hydraulic fluid on aircraft , while the red petroleum based fluid we used did . I never could wrap my brain around that .\"\\n 'Water is compressible , just not really until very high pressures . In thermodynamics , you can approximate a liquid to be non - compressible until super high pressures to make life easier . This approximation does break down , though . Fluids that are thought of as \" compressible \" are gasses , and it \\'s because in their state of matter , they are fairly spaced out as they just whizz through space . Because of this space between them , changing the pressure has a relatively drastic change in volume because the intermolecular forces are n\\'t acting very strongly . Contrasting this with both liquids and solids , the distance between the molecules is much lower , and intermolecular forces play a larger role . Atoms do n\\'t like to be too close together , requiring more pressure to change the volume . The most ideal hydraulic working fluid has zero compressibility , but this is n\\'t a property that any matter has . Having virtually zero compressibility - as is the case with water and petroleum based fluid - lends them to direct force effectively from one side to another . You can see this effect [ here ] ( URL_0 ) - the bulk modulus . This is the relationship between how much a pressure increase will decrease volume . As listed , gasses have a low value , liquids being a few orders of magnitude higher , and solids being even higher .']   \n",
       "9   [\"Ok firstly , head over to /r / homebrewing to see it in action ! Secondly , here 's a quick run through of the general process : 1 . The Wort is produced by mixing a starch source ( most often malted and crushed grains / barley a.k.a malts ) with hot water , this step is known as Mashing . This process takes a few hours , and causes the starches to break down into sugars . 2 . The Wort is drained from the malts , and the malts rinsed to remove as much of the sweet wort as possible . The sweet Wort and associated washings are trasnfered into a kettle ( known as a copper ) , and boiled for a few hours . This boils off some of the water , and produces a more concentrated Wort , allowing for a more efficient fermentation later on . The boiling also kills off any remaining enzymes / bacteria in the Wort , effectively sterylizing it . During the boil , hops are pitched into the Wort to add a bitter flavour . The longer the hops are boiled , the more bitter the final brew will be , but the less light - hoppy aroma you get on the palate . Careful selection of hop variety , as well as knowing when to pitch the hops is essential in producing the champion brews ! 3 . After the Wort is boiled , it 's cooled ready for the yeast . If the wort stays too hot it 'll kill the yeast , and you wo n't get any beer . Some breweries may hop the wort at this late stage , to give a powerfully hoppy aroma to the final brew . The hopped and cooled Wort is transfered to the fermenter , where the yeast is then pitched . During fermentation , the yeast digests the sugars in the Wort , producing ethanol ( alcohol - gets you drunk ) and carbon dioxide ( makes it gassy / fizzy ) . The fermentation step can take anywhere from days to months , depending on the brew .. but this long period allows any particulate matter to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter , resulting in a clear beer . 4 . Once the fermentation has finished , the final beer product is bottled / canned / casked . Then either stored on racks to mature , or sold and enjoyed straight away ! The different types of beers are usually achieved by the types of grains / hops used , as well as the stage in which the hops are pitched , how many hoppings are carried out etc .. sometimes the beer undergoes a few fermentations too .. With beer being up to 11,000 + years old , we 've had a long long time to perfect our methods and develop lots of different types !\"\\n \"in essences , beer is just : 1 ) Water - well , most of your beer is water . 2 ) Yeast - the thing that turns sugar in malts into alcohol during fermentation . there 's also various types of yeast for ales / lagers that give them different flavors and smell . 3 ) Malt - nowadays , there 's malt extracts , basically , a sugar syrup . however , you can always soak different grains for their sugar . again , different malt different flavors and smell . 4 ) Hops - they add flavors and preserves the beer . again , different hops different flavors and smell . ps . /r / homebrewing . you can start brewing your own beer ( 5gallons or ~50bottles ) < $ 100 .\"\\n '[ BOOM INFOGRAM IN YO FACE ] ( URL_0 )']   \n",

A * solution * to an equation is a set of number that satisfy that equation . For example , we can look at the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 . If we pick x to be 3 , y to be 4 , and z to be 5 , then we have a solution since x^2 + y^2 = 3 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5 ^ 2 = z^2 . Notice that our solution — x = 3 , y = 4 , z = 5 — is made of counting numbers ? We can consider a generalization of the above equation , x^n + y^n = z^n , where n is any counting number itself , and ask whether * that * equation has a solution made up entirely of counting numbers . For example , we could look at the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3 , or x^10 + y^10 = z^10 . So we 've established that if n is 2 , then there are solutions made up only of counting numbers ( we used 3 , 4 , and 5 ) . Fermat 's Last Theorem says that if n is * bigger * than 2 then you ca n't find a solution made up only of counting numbers . If two of the numbers in your solution are counting numbers , then the third one wo n't be a counting number . The known proof of this theorem can not be explained like you 're five . It is highly technical and relies on extremely advanced mathematical techniques developed in the late 1900s .\"\\n \"I ca n't explain it , this comment is n't big enough .\"\\n 'Fermat \\'s Last Theorem states that there do not exist three nonzero integers x , y , and z such that x^n + y^n = z^n for any n larger than 2 . This is in contrast to the case where n=1 , which is pretty trivial , and the case n=2 , where there are examples like 3 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 5 ^ 2 One way to see that this is sort of crazy if true , is to consider it this way : if x^n + y^n = z^n then ( x / z)^n + ( y / z)^n = 1 . Then the theorem comes down to saying there are no pairs ( x , y ) of nonzero rational numbers on the plane curve defined by the equation x^n + y^n = 1 . For n=4 , this curve looks like [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . By the FLT that curve slips \" in between \" all the rational number pairs , never hitting them except along the axes . The proof that this is true is one of the most complicated proofs in modern mathematics . It took 7 years for one of the world \\'s best mathematicians to finish . Any ELI5 description would be hopelessly inadequate . The proof involved taking two fields which were previously thought to be unrelated and showing they are actually the same . Once this was done ( or rather , a part of this , the full thing was done later ) , we can take the FLT and translate it to a problem in this other field , where there exist techniques to tackle it there .']   \n",

It's important for the fuselage to be strong so that the airplane can withstand the forces it experiences during flight, such as turbulence and changes in altitude.

There are many factors that can contribute to the development of depression, and these factors may have changed over time. One possibility is that our understanding of depression has improved over time, which has led to a better recognition and diagnosis of the condition. In the past, people may have attributed symptoms of depression to other causes or may not have had access to the same level of mental health care as is available today. Another possibility is that social and cultural factors may have played a role in the increased prevalence of depression. Changes in social structures, such as the increase in individualism and the breakdown of traditional social support systems, may have contributed to the development of depression in some people. Additionally, changes in lifestyle, such as increased stress and decreased physical activity, may also be contributing factors.

Whether to pursue a growth investing approach for a Roth IRA (or any other type of investment account) depends on an individual's financial situation, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.Growth investing typically involves buying stocks or other securities that have the potential for high capital appreciation over the long term. This approach can be suitable for investors who have a long time horizon (e.g., more than 10 years) and are willing to tolerate a higher level of risk.On the other hand, a Roth IRA is a type of retirement account that is funded with after-tax dollars and offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Because the main purpose of a Roth IRA is to save for retirement, it is generally recommended that investors take a long-term approach to investing.That being said, it is important to diversify your portfolio and not put all of your eggs in one basket. This means that in addition to growth investments, you may want to consider holding other types of investments such as bonds, real estate, and cash equivalents. The right asset allocation for you will depend on your individual circumstances and goals.It is a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional before making any investment decisions. They can help you understand your options and create a plan that is tailored to your needs.\"]   \n",

Ales are made with top-fermenting yeasts, which means the yeast rises to the top of the mixture as it ferments. Ales tend to have a fruitier and more complex flavor.

       "13  [\"Fermat's Last Theorem is a famous math problem that states that there are no whole numbers (also called integers) that can be used to solve the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for any value of n greater than 2. For example, the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3 has no solutions in whole numbers. Fermat's Last Theorem is called a theorem because it has been proven to be true. It was first proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in the 17th century, but it wasn't until 1994 that a mathematician named Andrew Wiles was able to provide a complete proof of the theorem. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is quite complex and requires a lot of advanced math. However, there is a simple way to understand why the theorem is true: if we try to find whole number solutions to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for any value of n greater than 2, we quickly run into problems. For example, if we try to find whole number solutions to the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3, we can quickly see that there are no solutions. This is because no matter what values we choose for x, y, and z, the left side of the equation (x^3 + y^3) will always be a multiple of 3 (since 3 is a factor of every whole number), while the right side of the equation (z^3) will never be a multiple of 3. This means that the equation can never be true, no matter what values we choose for x, y, and z. In conclusion, Fermat's Last Theorem states that there are no whole number solutions to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for any value of n greater than 2. This theorem was famously difficult to prove, but it has now been proven to be true by mathematician Andrew Wiles.\"]   \n",

Some people might prefer one console over the other based on the types of games that are available for it, the performance of the hardware, the design of the console, or the online services that are offered. Others might have had a negative experience with one of the consoles and therefore have a lower opinion of it.
